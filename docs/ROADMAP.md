# SRE Leadership Transition: 90-Day Roadmap

## Executive Summary

Transitioning from software engineering to Site Reliability Engineering leadership requires mastering both technical foundations and management practices unique to SRE. This comprehensive 90-day roadmap leverages your React/TypeScript/PHP background and basic Docker knowledge to build junior-level SRE competency while preparing you to effectively manage SRE teams and participate in technical ceremonies.

**The key insight**: SRE differs fundamentally from traditional software engineering by applying engineering principles to operational challenges, requiring a 50/50 split between operational work and engineering projects, guided by data-driven reliability metrics (SLIs, SLOs, and error budgets) rather than pursuing perfect uptime.

## Foundation: Understanding SRE principles and junior-level expectations

### Core SRE methodology centers on quantitative reliability management

**Service Level Framework** forms the foundation of all SRE work. Service Level Indicators (SLIs) measure quantitative aspects like latency, availability, and error rates. Service Level Objectives (SLOs) set target values (e.g., "99.9% of requests succeed within 100ms"). Error budgets calculate acceptable unreliability (100% - SLO), providing a framework for balancing reliability investments against feature velocity.

**Toil reduction** represents the engineering approach to operations. Toil includes manual, repetitive, automatable tasks that scale linearly with service growth. Google targets less than 50% of SRE time spent on toil, with the remainder dedicated to engineering projects that eliminate future toil through automation and improved system design.

**Junior SRE competencies** span both technical and operational domains. Essential technical skills include programming (Python, Go, or Java), Linux fundamentals, container orchestration with Kubernetes, Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Ansible), and observability tools (Prometheus, Grafana). Operational responsibilities include monitoring system health, executing runbooks, participating in on-call rotations, contributing to incident response, and implementing small automation projects under guidance.

### SRE management requires unique approaches compared to traditional engineering

**The 50/50 rule** mandates that SRE teams spend no more than 50% of time on operational work, with remaining time devoted to engineering projects. This non-negotiable principle requires active measurement and enforcement, distinguishing SRE from traditional operations roles.

**Blameless postmortem culture** focuses on system improvements rather than individual blame. Postmortems occur after user-visible downtime, data loss, or resolution times exceeding thresholds. The process includes timeline reconstruction, root cause analysis, action item identification, and organization-wide learning sharing.

**Cross-functional collaboration** differs significantly from traditional software engineering management. SRE managers must interface with product development teams (shared ownership model), infrastructure teams (platform dependencies), business stakeholders (reliability impact on revenue), and customer support (user-facing reliability issues).

## Critical tools and learning priorities for maximum impact

### Container orchestration builds on your existing Docker knowledge

**Kubernetes mastery** represents the highest-priority technical skill, mentioned in 43% of SRE job postings. Your existing Docker experience provides an excellent foundation for learning pod concepts, deployments, services, and configuration management. The conceptual mapping: Docker containers become Kubernetes pods, docker run commands translate to kubectl apply with deployments, and docker-compose files convert to Kubernetes manifests.

**Infrastructure as Code** through Terraform offers cloud-agnostic infrastructure provisioning using declarative configurations. Combined with Ansible for configuration management, these tools enable the automated, repeatable infrastructure deployment essential for SRE practices. Priority order: master Terraform basics first, then add Ansible for configuration management.

### Observability stack requires comprehensive monitoring approach

**LGTM Stack** (Loki, Grafana, Tempo, Mimir) provides cost-effective observability compared to traditional ELK stacks. Prometheus handles metrics collection with PromQL queries, Grafana creates dashboards and alerting, Loki aggregates logs, and Tempo traces distributed systems. This integration covers the "Four Golden Signals": latency, traffic, errors, and saturation.

**Cloud platform priorities** favor AWS for initial learning due to largest market share (32%), extensive documentation, and broad job market availability. Your expired GCP certification provides foundation knowledge, but AWS offers better learning resources and certification paths for SRE roles. Focus on core services: EC2, S3, VPC, CloudWatch, and CloudFormation.

## Structured learning resources and certification strategy

### Most effective programs combine theory with hands-on practice

**KodeKloud SRE Learning Path** offers the most comprehensive structured approach, combining SRE fundamentals with practical labs. The self-paced format allows completion within 60-90 days at $15/month for premium access. Coverage includes DevOps principles, networking, application development, and hands-on scenarios.

**DevOpsSchool SRE Certified Professional (SRECP)** provides industry-recognized certification with 69 hours of content covering complete SRE methodology. The program includes Prometheus, Grafana, Kubernetes, and Terraform training with real-world projects. Cost ranges from $180 for self-paced video to $600 for live interactive sessions.

**Free foundational resources** include Google's SRE books ("Site Reliability Engineering" and "The Site Reliability Workbook"), available online at no cost. These provide comprehensive theoretical foundation and real-world implementation examples from Google's production environments.

### Certification pathway prioritizes practical skills over credentials

**Kubernetes certifications** offer highest value for SRE roles. Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) costs $445 for hands-on exam testing real operational skills. Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD) at $395 focuses on developer-oriented container management.

**Cloud platform certifications** should align with organizational needs. AWS Solutions Architect Associate ($150) provides foundational cloud knowledge, while AWS DevOps Engineer Professional ($300) covers SRE-relevant automation and monitoring practices. Google Cloud Professional DevOps Engineer ($200) emphasizes SRE principles and GKE expertise.

**Budget allocation strategy**: Invest $1,500-3,000 total for balanced approach combining structured bootcamp, key certifications, and premium learning platforms. This provides optimal return on learning investment within 90-day timeframe.

## Hands-on projects for rapid skill development

### Progressive project structure builds competency systematically

**Phase 1 (Days 1-30): Foundation projects** focus on basic monitoring and infrastructure automation. Deploy Prometheus + Grafana monitoring stack for system metrics visualization. Create basic Terraform configurations for cloud resource provisioning. Build simple Kubernetes applications converting your Docker knowledge to container orchestration. Time investment: 2-3 hours daily.

**Phase 2 (Days 31-60): Integration projects** combine multiple tools for realistic SRE scenarios. Implement complete observability stack with LGTM components. Create incident response simulations using chaos engineering tools like Chaos Mesh or AWS Fault Injection Simulator. Develop SLI/SLO definitions for sample applications with error budget tracking. Time investment: 3-4 hours daily.

**Phase 3 (Days 61-90): Production-ready implementations** demonstrate junior-level competency. Build end-to-end CI/CD pipelines with automated testing and deployment. Implement service mesh with Linkerd for microservices communication. Create comprehensive monitoring dashboards with alerting for production scenarios. Time investment: 4-5 hours daily.

### Portfolio projects demonstrate SRE capabilities to stakeholders

**Essential portfolio components** include complete monitoring solution for microservices application, infrastructure automation with Terraform and Ansible, incident response framework with automated recovery procedures, and CI/CD pipeline with quality gates and reliability checks.

**GitHub organization structure** should include clear README files, architecture documentation, system diagrams, metrics and results demonstrating reliability improvements, and learning reflections documenting challenges and solutions.

## Management transition strategy and avoiding common pitfalls

### Building technical credibility requires hands-on engagement

**Technical depth maintenance** distinguishes SRE management from traditional engineering management. SRE managers must participate in incident response escalations, review SRE tooling code, engage in architectural discussions with technical depth, and maintain understanding of production systems. Teams lose respect when managers cannot contribute technically to complex problem-solving.

**Learning SRE-specific technologies** includes mastering monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana), container orchestration (Kubernetes), Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Ansible), and cloud platforms relevant to your organization. Dedicate 30-45 minutes daily to documentation and theory, plus 1.5-3 hours hands-on practice.

### Common pitfalls center on cultural misunderstandings

**Treating SRE as traditional operations** represents the biggest mistake. This leads to focusing on keeping systems running versus improving them, accepting manual toil instead of automating it away, and reactive incident response versus proactive reliability engineering. SRE requires engineering solutions to operational challenges, not just maintaining existing systems.

**Perfectionism trap** involves aiming for 100% reliability because it seems like the right goal. This wastes resources on diminishing returns, prevents innovation and feature velocity, and ignores user experience reality (users don't notice 99.9% versus 99.99% availability). Error budgets provide framework for making data-driven reliability investment decisions.

**Insufficient error budget policy enforcement** undermines SRE credibility. When policies aren't followed, teams lose trust in the framework, feature teams continue risky releases without consequences, and reliability becomes secondary to feature velocity. Managers must consistently enforce agreed-upon error budget policies.

## Leveraging existing software engineering skills in SRE context

### Directly applicable skills transfer with adaptation requirements

**Project management and technical leadership** skills transfer directly to SRE reliability projects, requiring similar planning, execution, and cross-team coordination. Code review processes apply to SRE tooling and automation development. Software architecture principles apply to designing SRE systems and tools.

**API design and testing experience** becomes valuable for building SRE automation tools, monitoring systems, and integration with existing services. Your React/TypeScript background provides excellent foundation for building internal SRE dashboards and tools. PHP experience with web applications helps understand distributed system challenges and reliability requirements.

**CI/CD experience** adapts to SRE-specific needs including automated testing of infrastructure changes, deployment pipeline integration with reliability checks, automated rollback triggers based on SLI degradation, and progressive rollout strategies with monitoring checkpoints.

### Context adaptation focuses on operational excellence

**Shift from project-based to service-based thinking** requires understanding production systems holistically, balancing proactive engineering with reactive incident response, and focusing on long-term system reliability rather than feature delivery cycles.

**Risk management approach** changes from minimizing risk to embracing calculated risk through error budgets. SRE managers must accept that failures will happen and are normal, use failure as learning opportunities, and make risk-based decisions about reliability investments based on user impact and business value.

## Junior-level SRE competency benchmarks and success metrics
